## Notes

The challenges in this project came with using JavaScript and using CSS to get the visuals I wanted. JavaScript can manipulate element's HTML and their CSS, and getting familiar with which takes priority took some testing of the code. The JavaScript conflicted with CSS rules and it changed the appearance. What helped this issue was using the Inspect Element feature on the local web server to find where there were issues and in what element, this made troubleshooting a lot easier. 

My previous experience in CSS involved using Bootstrap, some aspects such as wrapping, margins, and padding, were slightly different syntax-wise to achieve. The framework combines a few CSS rules and focuses the styling to be mostly placed in the HTML file, based on my experience. I was, however, still able to achieve a responsive web design, which I tested using the Inspect Element Device Toolbar.
